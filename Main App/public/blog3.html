  <h1>🚧 Outer Ring Road Project Stalled Following Supreme Court Ruling</h1>
  
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>Thiruvananthapuram:</strong> The Supreme Court's <span class="highlight">May 16, 2025</span> judgment invalidating post-facto environmental clearances has delivered a significant blow to the Outer Ring Road (ORR) project in the city.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>The <strong>National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)</strong> is awaiting environmental clearance (EC) for the <strong>northern section</strong> of the ORR, between Thekkada and Navaikulam. In contrast, the southern stretch—Thekkada to Vizhinjam—was approved in 2023. Without this clearance, compensation payments to landowners are frozen.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>⚖️ Legal Bottleneck</h2>
    <p>The issue is compounded by the expiration of the <strong>State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA)</strong> in March 2025. Until a new committee is formed, the responsibility lies with the Union ministry, which can no longer issue post-facto clearances due to the Supreme Court's decision.</p>
    <p>"This judgment has created an unexpected legal bottleneck," said a senior NHAI official. "We were ready to initiate compensation, but we are not legally permitted to proceed without clearance."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🏗️ Project Delays and Public Frustration</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Rs 4,767-crore ORR project</strong>, sanctioned in August 2024 and spanning 63 km, aims to decongest traffic and improve connectivity to the Vizhinjam International Seaport. Construction was slated to begin in April 2025 but now faces indefinite delays.</p>
    <p>"This is a case of administrative delay compounding a legal issue," said <strong>S Chandramohan Nair</strong>, convener of the action council for affected landowners. "People have waited for months for compensation, and now we're back to square one."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Landowners recently staged a protest at the NHAI regional office in Chackai. They paused the protest after NHAI's regional officer <strong>BL Meena</strong> promised compensation within a month or the project’s cancellation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>💰 Funds Allocated, But No Payout</h2>
    <p>In January 2025, the district administration transferred <strong>Rs 700 crore</strong> to NHAI for land compensation across 11 villages. Yet, no disbursements have been made to landowners due to the pending EC.</p>
    <p>SEIAA officials stated that reconstitution of the committee is under active consideration and expected soon, which may help end the stalemate.</p>
