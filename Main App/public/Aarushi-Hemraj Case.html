</header>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The 2008 Noida double murder case refers to the unsolved murders of 13-year-old girl Aarushi Talwar and 45-year-old man Yam Prasad "Hemraj" Banjade, a live-in domestic worker employed by her family. The two were killed on the night of 15–16 May 2008 at Aarushi's home in Noida, India.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Aarushi Talwar was a student at the Delhi Public School and the daughter of Dr. Rajesh Talwar and Dr. Nupur Talwar, both dentists. The family lived in an apartment in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.</p>

    <h2>Events Preceding the Murders</h2>
    <p>On the night of 15 May 2008, Aarushi was given a digital camera as an early birthday gift. The last known activity was around 10:10 PM when she took a photograph of herself.</p>

    <h2>Discovery of the Bodies</h2>
    <p>On 16 May 2008, Aarushi's body was discovered in her bedroom, and Hemraj's body was found the next day on the terrace. The police faced criticism for their handling of the crime scene.</p>

        <h2>Key Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The case remains unsolved despite extensive media coverage and public interest.</li>
            <li>The Talwars were initially accused but were later acquitted due to lack of evidence.</li>
            <li>The investigation has been criticized for its numerous lapses and mishandling of evidence.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Public Attention</h2>
    <p>The case attracted significant media attention, leading to a sensationalist portrayal of the events and the individuals involved. The Supreme Court criticized the media for its coverage.</p>
    <h2>Court verdict</h2>
    <p>
On 25 November 2013, a special CBI court held Rajesh and Nupur Talwar guilty for the two murders. The Special Judge Shyam Lal convicted the couple for murder, destruction of evidence, misleading the probe and filing a wrong FIR.[167] On 26 November 2013, they were sentenced to life imprisonment for the twin murders.[168]

The Talwar family called the verdict a miscarriage of justice, and alleged that the points proving innocence of Rajesh and Nupur[169] were not produced by the CBI before the court.[170] Journalist Avirook Sen alleged that the judge wrote the case verdict even before the defence side finished their arguments.[171] In January 2014, the Talwars challenged the decision in the Allahabad High Court.[172]

On 12 October 2017, the High Court acquitted the Talwars of all charges, stating that the evidence presented by the CBI against the Talwars was not satisfactory beyond reasonable doubt, and therefore they must be given benefit of the doubt instead of being convicted based solely on suspicion.[173] The High Court castigated the CBI for its theory on the murder of domestic help Hemraj in the Aarushi murder case, saying it was an "impossible hypothesis" and "patently absurd".[174] The verdict was criticized as unjust by Hemraj's wife Khumkala,[175] and her brother Ashok Bhushal.[176] Hemraj's family members and relatives in Nepal continue to believe that the Talwars are guilty.[177]

A book analyzing the trial court verdict titled 'The Killing of Aarushi and the Murder of Justice' critiques the judgment as well as the quality of evidence that was tendered in the case.[178] It also argues that the Aarushi case holds up a mirror to similar cases of injustice in thousands of other criminal cases in India.

On 8 March 2018, the CBI challenged the acquittal in the Supreme Court,[179] and on 10 August, the Supreme Court admitted the CBI's appeal.[180]</p>
