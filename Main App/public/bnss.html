                person:
                <br>Provided that where at the time of the issue of the proclamation the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or otherwise, that the person in relation to whom the proclamation is to be issued,-
                <br>(a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property; or
                <br>(b) is about to remove the whole or any part of his property from the local jurisdiction of the Court,
                <br>it may order the attachment of property simultaneously with the issue of the proclamation.
                <br>(2) Such order shall authorise the attachment of any property belonging to such person within the district in which it is made; and it shall authorise the attachment of any property belonging to such person without such district when
                endorsed by the District Magistrate within whose district such property is situate.
                <br>(3) If the property ordered to be attached is a debt or other movable property, the attachment under this section shall be made-
                <br>(a) by seizure; or
                <br>(b) by the appointment of a receiver; or

                <br>(4) If the property ordered to be attached is immovable, the attachment under this section shall, in the case of land paying revenue to the State Government, be made through the Collector of the district in which the land is situate,
                and in all other cases-
                <br>(a) by taking possession; or
                <br>(b) by the appointment of a receiver; or
                <br>(c) by an order in writing prohibiting the payment of rent on delivery of property to the proclaimed person or to any one on his behalf; or
                <br>(d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit.
                <br>(5) If the property ordered to be attached consists of live-stock or is of a perishable nature, the Court may, if it thinks it expedient, order immediate sale thereof, and in such case the proceeds of the sale shall abide the order
                of the Court.
