  <h1>🚸 Child Legal Aid in Maharashtra: A Call for Action</h1>
  <div class="author">By Rosy Sequeira, Special Correspondent, Times of India</div>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>Mumbai:</strong> The Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority (MSLSA) has informed the Bombay High Court that family courts have yet to refer any cases for providing legal services to children in matters of custody, guardianship, or maintenance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>In a response dated March 23, 2025, to a PIL by advocate Shraddha Dalvi, MSLSA stated that not a single case had been forwarded to the Legal Services Units for Children (LSCUs), which were established in every district in November 2024 under the National Legal Services Authority's scheme.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🔎 The PIL's Demand</h2>
    <p>Advocate Dalvi's petition urged the formation of guidelines for a child legal assistance programme in Maharashtra. It emphasized the appointment of independent lawyers for children involved in custody disputes and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📘 The Law and Entitlements</h2>
    <p>The Legal Services Authorities Act entitles children to free legal aid. The Women and Child Development Department affirmed in its April 23 reply that guidelines issued in May 2015 allow families to seek expert assistance during both pre-trial and trial stages in POCSO cases.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>⚖️ Children: The Silent Sufferers</h2>
    <p>Dalvi's petition highlights that children are often the "most unheard and unrepresented" in matrimonial cases. With over 2 lakh such disputes filed annually nationwide and more than 10,000 in Mumbai alone, the absence of dedicated legal support can lead to severe mental distress for children, particularly in cases involving sexual assault or manipulation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>"Independent lawyers will help the child to express their concerns without bias and guide them towards balanced decisions," the petition argues.</p>
